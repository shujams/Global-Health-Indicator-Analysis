    infant mortality rates?

Analysis to be completed for USA, China, Germany, and Brazil.

In this project we conductive extensive data research, cleaning, and
analysis of health indicator data of various countries. We decided upon
using the latest data from the last decade for USA, China, Germany, and
Brazil. We then calculated the statistical r values to quantify
correlations between measles immunization rates, infant mortality rates,
and national GNP rates.

In our immunization rates vs infant mortality analysis, all four of the
countries analyzed had *negative r values*, indicating that while
*immunization rates increased, infant mortality rates decreased.\

But in our immunization rates vs GNP analysis, all four of the countries
analyzed had *positive r values*, indicating that while *GNP rates
increased, immunization rates also increased*.

While further research and analysis is certainly required to establish a
firm causative relationship, our research and analysis provided
fascinating insights into the field of global health.
